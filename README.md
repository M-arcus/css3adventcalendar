# PHP & CSS3 Advent Calendar

![Screenshot][example/screenshot.png]

## Introduction

This is a small project that aims to help creating HTML-based advent calendars. It uses CSS3 transitions to create a 3D door opening effect.

## Browser support

Unfortunately, older versions of Internet Explorer do not support CSS3 that well. The example calendar uses a fallback where the calendar doors are just hidden on hover.

## Example Images
